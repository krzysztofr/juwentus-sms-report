# juwentus-sms-report

SMS reports about actions in the Juwentus system (monitoring company).

## Compatibility

The script is compatible with the old version of the interface (https://ochrona.juwentus.pl/). It is not compatible with new Juwentus24online. New interface has an option of delivering notifications to e-mail, so that's what I switched to.

## Running tests

`python -m unittest tests`

## Downloading log

`python parse.py parse`
